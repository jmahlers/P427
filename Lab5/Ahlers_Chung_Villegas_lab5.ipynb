    "The Kortewegâ€“de Vries (KdV) equation approximately describes the amplitude of waves in certain one-dimensional systems, for example the height of water waves in a shallow trough.  There is a class of static solutions to this equation where waves will hold their shape while the system is not disrupted.  In the real world, the KdV equation includes time dependence - a more difficult problem we will not examine yet.  However, you have likely seem some examples of static wave configurations in flowing water, such as stationary ripples in a creek or stream.  Extreme examples of this are even [surfable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6f8oLu8t8M)!\n",

    "3. You will notice that the resulting function seems periodic. What is the period of the oscillations of this function? Here the period means the $x$ distance between adjacent maxima or minima.\n",
    "4. Determine the minimim, maximum, and average wave height. Note that the average is not necessarily the average of the min and the max. Print these results.\n",
